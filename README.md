## What is TensorBase
TensorBase is a modern engineering effort for building a high performance and cost-effective bigdata warehouse in an open source culture. 


## Status
TensorBase has released **milestone 0** as the developer previewing release for inviting more interesting contributors to join in. 

* **TensorBase is an architectural performance design.** 

[It is demonstrated](https://tensorbase.io/2020/08/04/hello-base.html#benchmark) to **query ~1.5 billion rows of NYC taxi dataset in ~100 milliseconds** for total response time in its milestone 0. This is **6x faster than that of ClickHouse**.

* **TensorBase is a highly hackable system** 

TensorBase is written from scratch in Rust language and its friend C. Here with comfortable languages and minimized dependencies, from-scratch architecting, you now use the most familiar tools to challenge the most difficult problems.

If you like this project, please give a star to help it more grown.

## Roadmap

The coming [m1](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/milestone/1) will be the first milestone which is targeted to provide a production-friendly release. 

A speicial edition will be shown to the interesting personals and oraganizations. Subscribe to [TensorBase's Newsletter here](https://tensorbase.io/#contact) to get the first time information if you are interesting.

## Try TensorBase
TensorBase is developed for Linux, but should work for any docker enabled system (for example, Windows 10 WSL2).

* from source

TensorBase follows the idiomatic development flow of Rust. Make sure your Rust nightly toolchain works. If you only try to run, just play with [Quick Start](#quick-start). Thanks to the strong rust ecosystem, it is not necessary to run build first. Please check [prerequisites](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/blob/master/docs/dev.md#prerequisites) before running from soruce.

* docker

This mode is portable (but has some platform dependent resource and performance effects).

Try like this:

```bash
docker pull tensorbase/tensorbase:m0
docker run -ti tensorbase/tensorbase:m0 /bin/bash
>> /base/baseshell
```

then run a sum agg sql with the preshipped data (1MB):
```sql
select sum(trip_id) from nyc_taxi
```


## Quick Start
Now TensorBase provides two binaries to enable the following workflow:

* baseops: cli/workbench for devops, including kinds of processes/roles starts/stop

* baseshell: query client (now is a monolithic to include everything), m0 only supports query with single integer column type sum aggregation intentionally.

1. run _baseops_ to create a table definition in Base
```bash
cargo run --bin baseops table create -c samples/nyc_taxi_create_table_sample.sql
```
Base explicitly separates write/mutation behaviors into the cli baseops. the provided sql file is just an ansi-SQL DDL script, which can be seen in the [*samples* directory of repo](samples).

2. run _baseops_ to import [nyc_taxi csv dataset](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/getting-started/example-datasets/nyc-taxi/) into Base
```bash
cargo run --release --bin baseops import csv -c /jian/nyc-taxi.csv -i nyc_taxi:trip_id,pickup_datetime,passenger_count:0,2,10:51
```
Base import tool uniquely supports to import csv partially into storage like above. Use help to get more infos.

3. run _baseshell_ to issue query against Base
```bash
cargo run --release --bin baseshell
```

[Dev Docs](/docs/dev.md) provides a little more explanation for why above commands work.
